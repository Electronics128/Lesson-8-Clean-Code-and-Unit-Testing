# Lesson 8: Clean Code and Unit Testing

This lesson focuses on writing clean, readable Python code and testing it using unit tests. You'll learn about code refactoring, following PEP 8 standards, and handling edge cases.

## Objectives:
- Write clean and readable Python code.
- Refactor messy code for better readability.
- Follow PEP 8 coding standards.
- Use Python's `unittest` framework for testing.
- Debug code with unit tests and assertions.

## TODOs:
1. Use meaningful variable names in functions.
2. Add comments to explain your code.
3. Refactor messy code to make it cleaner.
4. Write reusable functions for repeated tasks.
5. Fix formatting issues to adhere to PEP 8 standards.
6. Write a unit test using Python's `unittest` framework.
7. Use assertions to verify function correctness.
8. Handle edge cases in functions and write corresponding tests.
9. Debug faulty functions using unit tests.
10. Document functions with docstrings.

## How to Complete the Lesson:
1. Open `lesson_08.py` and complete the TODOs.
2. Run the script and ensure it works as expected.

## How to Test Your Code:
Run the test script to verify your solutions:

```bash
python3 -m unittest test_lesson_08.py
